This thesis would not have been possible without the help and support from everyone involved with the Chicagoland Computational Traineeship in High-Energy Particle Physics ($C^{2}-THE-P^{2}$) and the NIU Physics Department.
I'd like to thank Jahred Adelman, for showing me an opportunity to start a journey I plan to continue, and for being a truly excellent advisor.
My mentors at Argonne National Laboratory, Alaettin Serhan Mete and Peter van Gemmeren, for each having made the time and boundless patience to help me through a fairly steep learning curve.
I'd also like to thank my fellow graduate students from NIU and the traineeship for inspiring me to do the best work I could do.
