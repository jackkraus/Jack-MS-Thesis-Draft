Building a toy model for derivation production jobs provides a schema by which it makes using real data and Monte Carlo simulated data much simpler.
One general principle about both data and Monte Carlo is the branch data within both is made up a mixture of randomized floats and repeated integer-like data. 
If we test the ideas behind limiting basket sizes to see how it affects compression, effects should be evident.
