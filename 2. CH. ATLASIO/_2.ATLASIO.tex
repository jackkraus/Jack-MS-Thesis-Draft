At any given time, code changes to Athena or the LCG stack could break various core I/O functionality. 
A measure often taken to ensure stability and security of essential code functionality is the involvement of unit testing during continuous integration of new software. [Do I need to cite this ????] 
It's not always the case that new core I/O functionality is integrated into Athena with new unit tests.

\subsection{What is Athena}
Athena is the open-source software framework for ATLAS. [Cite here]
It relies on other software such as ROOT, Geant4 and other software as part of the LCG software stack. [cite here]
