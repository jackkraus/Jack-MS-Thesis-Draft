Athena uses a number of unit tests during the development lifecycle to ensure core I/O functionality does not break.
Many of the I/O tests were originally created for the old EDM and haven't been updated to test the xAOD EDMs core I/O functions.
This project took in track information from a unit test using the T/P EDM, writes the data into an example xAOD object to file and reads it back.


\section{xAOD Test Object}
\label{sec:Mod_utests_xAOD_object}

% Overview
The object used to employ the new unit test is the \verb|xAOD::ExampleElectron| object, where the \verb|xAOD::| is a declaration of the namespace and simply identifies the object as an xAOD object.
An individual \verb|ExampleElectron| object only has a few parameters for sake of testing, its transvese momentum, \verb|pt|, and its charge, \verb|charge|.
A collection of \verb|ExampleElectron| objects are stored in the \verb|ExampleElectronContainer| object, which is just a \verb|DataVector| of \verb|ExampleElectron| objects.\cite{Buckley_2015}
This \verb|DataVector<xAOD::ExampleElectron>| acts similar to a \verb|std::vector<xAOD::ExampleElectron>|, but has additional code to handle the separation of interface and auxiliary data storage. 

% Aux Store
The xAOD EDM uses an abstract interface connecting between the \verb|DataVector| and the auxiliary data, this is the \verb|AuxStore|. 
The function \verb|setStore| is responsible for ensuring the auxillary data store is matched with it's corresponding \verb|DataVector|.
Another feature to the xAOD EDM is the ability to have a dynamic store of auxiliary data.
This separates the auxiliary data between static and dynamic data stores. 
Where the static dta stores comprise of known variables and the dynamic counterpart stores data of variables not declared but still might be needed by the user. 
Figure \ref{fig:Mod_utests_aux_store} illustrates how a simple setup of storing a \verb|DataVector| of electrons that hold some specific parameters into one \verb|AuxStore| while also having a separate \verb|AuxStore| specifically for the dynamic attributes.

\section{Unit Tests}
\label{sec:Mod_utests_CI}
Unit tests are programs that act as a catch during the continuous integration of a codebase and exhaust features that need to remain functional. 
Athena has a number of unit tests which check every merge request and nightly build for issues in the new code that could break core I/O functionality, either at the level of Athena, ROOT, or any other software in the LCG stack.
With the adoption of the xAOD EDM, there were no unit tests to cover core I/O functionality related to this new EDM. 

Specifically there were no unit tests to handle selection of dynamic attributes, or decorations, on xAOD objects created during writing and read back.
To address this, a new xAOD test object needed to be created and written during a new unit test that fit into the existing unit tests.
The list of AthenaPoolExample unit tests that are currently executed during a nightly build can be found in Table \ref{tab:CI_Unit_Tests}.

The mechanism for passing a unit test done automatically by building the framework, running the unit tests, and comparing the diff of the output file to the unit test with a reference file associated with that particular unit test. 
If the unit test passes, then the diff will be empty and the unit test will be marked as passing.
Conversely, if the unit test fails, then the diff will be non-empty and the unit test will be marked as failing.

These tests are executed in this order, as the objects created in one might be used in proceeding test.
The two new tests were \verb|WritexAODElectron| and \verb|ReadxAODElectron|. 
During the \verb|WritexAODElectron| unit test, the first call is to the \verb|ReadData| algorithm to read off all of the \verb|ExampleTrack| objects stored in one of the files produced by the \verb|ReadWrite| unit-test.
Then the \verb|WriteExampleElectron| algorithm is called and takes \verb|ExampleTracks|, creates an \verb|ExampleElectron| object and sets the electrons \verb|pt| to the tracks \verb|pt|. 
Within the same algorithm, the next step is to loop over each of the newly produced \verb|ExampleElectrons|, accessing the decorations \verb|decor1| and \verb|decor2|, and setting each to an arbitrary float value that are easily identifiable later.
The \verb|ReadxAODElectron| unit test will attempt to show the xAOD function of accessing one dynamic variable, in this case \verb|decor1|, while not accessing the other, \verb|decor2|.


The way the xAOD::ExampleElectron object is accessed in the unit test is by utilizing StoreGate and its WriteHandleKey.
