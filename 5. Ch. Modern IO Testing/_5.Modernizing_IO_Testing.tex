\section{Continuous integration unit tests}
Unit tests are programs that act as a catch during the continuous integration of a codebase and exhaust features that need to remain functional. 
Athena has a number of unit tests which check every new merge request and nightly build for issues in the new code that could break core I/O functionality, either at the level of Athena, ROOT, or any other software in the LCG stack.
With the adoption of the xAOD EDM, there were no unit tests to cover core I/O functionality related to this new EDM.
