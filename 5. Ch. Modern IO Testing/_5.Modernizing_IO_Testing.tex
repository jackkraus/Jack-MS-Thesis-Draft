Athena uses a number of unit tests during the development lifecycle to ensure core I/O functionality does not break.
Many of the I/O tests were originally created for the old EDM and haven't been updated to test the xAOD EDMs core I/O functions.
This project took in track information from a unit test using the T/P EDM, writes the data into an example xAOD object to file and reads it back.

\section{CI Unit Tests}
Unit tests are programs that act as a catch during the continuous integration of a codebase and exhaust features that need to remain functional. 
Athena has a number of unit tests which check every new merge request and nightly build for issues in the new code that could break core I/O functionality, either at the level of Athena, ROOT, or any other software in the LCG stack.
With the adoption of the xAOD EDM, there were no unit tests to cover core I/O functionality related to this new EDM.
